A describtion of this addons code:

This addon mkae a lot use of lua whever possible, even, [side] definions
were moved to lua by using scenario_generation=lua, that by the [mulitplayer]
tags are nearly empty. One of the main advantage of this is that this addon
doesn't increase the wesnoth parsing time,  also i just fiond lua easier to
read and much easier to debug.

The directoy is organizes as follows:

./lua/map :
the files in ./lua/map contain the code that generate the content of the
[multiplayer] tag, in particular [side] definions, [event]s, map_data and
[load_ressource]. The biggest part of the scenario is the map generation,
Worl conquestII map genertion works as follows, first we run the wesnoth 
default mpa generator (here: the files in lua/map/generator), then we run
a custom lua scrips to fix it up (lua/map/postgeneration). For each
scenario there ia a fixed set of generator+postgenerator pairs defeined in
lua/map/scenarios for each scenario.

./lua/shared_utils :
libraries and helper functions that are used by both the map editor and
during the actual game.

./lua/optional_mechanics :
A few lua machnics that works independends on the rest of the world conquest

function. And delivering wc2 data that depends on the current era (for
example which heros should be available for which faction)

./lua/game_mechanics :
THe lau code that implementes the custom game meachnics of wcii, that is
